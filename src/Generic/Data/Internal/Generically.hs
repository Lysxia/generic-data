-- | Product type with generic instances of 'Semigroup' and 'Monoid'.
--
-- This is similar to 'Generic.Data.Generically' in most cases, but
-- 'GenericProduct' also works for types @T@ with deriving
-- @via 'GenericProduct' U@, where @U@ is a generic product type coercible to,
-- but distinct from @T@. In particular, @U@ may not have an instance of
-- 'Semigroup', which 'Generic.Data.Generically' requires.
--
-- === __Example__
--
-- >>> :set -XDeriveGeneric -XDerivingVia
-- >>> data Point a = Point a a deriving Generic
-- >>> :{
--   newtype Vector a = Vector (Point a)
--     deriving (Semigroup, Monoid)
--       via GenericProduct (Point (Sum a))
-- :}
--
-- If it were @via 'Generic.Data.Generically' (Point (Sum a))@ instead, then
-- @Vector@'s 'mappend' (the 'Monoid' method) would be defined as @Point@'s
-- @('<>')@ (the 'Semigroup' method), which might not exist, or might not be
-- equivalent to @Vector@'s generic 'Semigroup' instance, which would be
-- unlawful.
